In the previous section we presented a high-level overview of the Internet and net-
working protocols. We are now going to delve a bit more deeply into the compo-
nents of a computer network (and the Internet, in particular). We begin in this
section at the edge of a network and look at the components with which we are most
familiar—namely, the computers, smartphones and other devices that we use on a
daily basis. In the next section we’ll move from the network edge to the network
core and examine switching and routing in computer networks.
Recall from the previous section that in computer networking jargon, the com-
puters and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as end sys-
tems. They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet,
as shown in Figure 1.3. The Internet’s end systems include desktop computers (e.g.,
desktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and e-mail servers), and
mobile computers (e.g., laptops, smartphones, and tablets). Furthermore, an increas-
ing number of non-traditional devices are being attached to the Internet as end sys-
tems (see sidebar).
End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) appli-
cation programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail
client program, or an e-mail server program. Throughout this book we will use the
terms hosts and end systems interchangeably; that is, host = end system. Hosts are
sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. Informally,
clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers
tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream
video, relay e-mail, and so on.
